h1. Conductor Importer

This gem assists in transferring content and assets from one page to a
Conductor page.

h2. Map

Below is an example map.

<pre>
{
  "batch_key":"1",
  "base_source_url":"http://vocation.nd.edu/",
  "base_target_url":"http://localhost:3000/",
  "source_is_conductor":true,
  "entries":
  [
    {
      "source_url":"/seminary/visual-tour-of-moreau-seminary/",
      "target_url":"/visual-tour-of-moreau-seminary/",
      "name":"Visual Tour of Moreau Seminary",
      "template":"page",
      "content_map":
      [
        {
          "selector_method_chain":[["at", "#content #banner"], ["following_siblings"]],
          "target_attribute":"content"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

As the content is transferred, images and links need to be processed as well to ensure that we are properly transferring them as well.
